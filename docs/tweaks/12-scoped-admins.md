# Assign admins to specific scopes and prevent them modify anything else

Convert any user on the platform (that is not currently an admin) to a limited subset of participatory spaces or event compoponents. Just add users to a box and scope them to some constraints. These users will se the "Edit" button in everywhere they have permissions. Any access to unallowed zones will redirect the user to the admin index page.
