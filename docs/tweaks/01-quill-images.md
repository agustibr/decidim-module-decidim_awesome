# Image support for the Quill editor

Modifies the WYSIWYG editor in Decidim by adding the possibility to insert images. When uploading images, Drag & Drop is supported. Images will be uploaded to the server and inserted as external resources (it doesn't use base64 in-line encoding).

This feature allows you use images in newsletters as well.
