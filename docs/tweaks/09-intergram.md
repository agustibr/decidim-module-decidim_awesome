# Live support chat

With this feature you can have a support chat in Decidim. It is linked to a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) group or a single user chat using the [[IntergramBot](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@IntergramBot). Just invite the bot to a group or chat with it directly, grab your ID, put it on the Awesome settings and have fun!. For more info or for hosting your own version of the bot check the [Intergram project](https://github.com/idoco/intergram).
