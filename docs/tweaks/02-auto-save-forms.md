# Auto-save for surveys and forms

With this feature admins can activate (globally or scoped) an auto-save feature for any form in Decidim.

It works purely in the client side by using LocalStorage capabilities of the browser. Data is store every time any field changes and retrieved automatically if the same user with the same browser returns to it in the future.

Saving the form removes the stored data.
